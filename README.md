# Dotfiles

My Doom-themed linux desktop configuration. I cannot guarantee it works first try, 
as an environment implies many hidden and not necessarily evident dependencies, but I hope
my configuration can help some people make their own rice like other people's dotfiles helped
me build mine.

## Dependencies

* [Rounded i3-gaps](https://github.com/resloved/i3)
* [Tryone's compton fork](https://github.com/tryone144/compton)
* [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)
* [AmazDoom font](https://www.dafont.com/amazdoom.font)
* [BigBlue Terminal and Fira Code Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

## Examples
